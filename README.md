## Notes for FluentPython(Luciano Ramalho)
This reference book is targeted to senior programmers. As a beginner which can be called CaiNiao programmer in Chinese, I face a lot of obstacles.

As a result, I refer to other resources online and make detailed comments. You can refer to my comments about the codes from the book and you can also check the [official document](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/dev/index.html).

Hope you a fluent journey in Python!
